utils.itemsflavourtext.msg_armor_1=Don't list'n to the lies, I swear they all lies. \nYou know I could be your knight in shining armor. 
utils.itemsflavourtext.msg_artifact_1=That is not dead which can eternal lie, \nAnd with strange aeons even death may die.
utils.itemsflavourtext.msg_artifact_2=In his house at R'lyeh dead Cthulhu waits dreaming.
utils.itemsflavourtext.msg_meleew_1=Any tool is a weapon if you hold it right.
utils.itemsflavourtext.msg_missilew_1=The oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear. 
utils.itemsflavourtext.msg_ring_1=Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn.
utils.itemsflavourtext.msg_stone_1=I know always that I am an outsider; a stranger in this century and among those who are still men.
utils.itemsflavourtext.msg_wand_1=If I am mad, it is mercy! May the gods pity the man who in his callousness can remain sane to the hideous end!
utils.itemsflavourtext.msg_artifact_10=We live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity, and it was not meant that we should voyage far.
utils.itemsflavourtext.msg_artifact_3=The Old Ones were, the Old Ones are, and the Old Ones shall be. Not in the spaces we know, but between them. They walk serene and primal, undimensioned and to us unseen.
utils.itemsflavourtext.msg_artifact_4=There are horrors beyond life's edge that we do not suspect, and once in a while man's evil prying calls them just within our range.
utils.itemsflavourtext.msg_artifact_5=I felt myself on the edge of the world; peering over the rim into a fathomless chaos of eternal night.
utils.itemsflavourtext.msg_artifact_6=I have harnessed the shadows that stride from world to world to sow death and madness.
utils.itemsflavourtext.msg_artifact_7=I could not help feeling that they were evil things -- mountains of madness whose farther slopes looked out over some accursed ultimate abyss.
utils.itemsflavourtext.msg_artifact_8=I have looked upon all the universe has to hold of horror, and even the skies of spring and flowers of summer must ever afterward be poison to me.
utils.itemsflavourtext.msg_artifact_9=The most merciful thing in the world... is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents.
utils.itemsflavourtext.msg_armor_2=Bow down, I am the emperor of dreams.
utils.itemsflavourtext.msg_armor_10=The man who smiles when things go wrong has thought of someone to blame it on.
utils.itemsflavourtext.msg_armor_3=Stern and white as a tomb, older than the memory of the dead, and built by men or devils beyond the recording of myth, is the mansion in which we dwell.
utils.itemsflavourtext.msg_armor_4=To destroy wonder and mystery, is to destroy the only elements that make existence tolerable. 
utils.itemsflavourtext.msg_armor_5=All human thought, all science, all religion, is the holding of a candle to the night of the universe.
utils.itemsflavourtext.msg_armor_6=Psychoanalysis and dianetics are, on the face of it, both absurd. People are what they are because of causes that go infinitely farther back than infancy of the mother's womb.
utils.itemsflavourtext.msg_armor_7=We don’t know whether they’re going to eat us or elect us for their tribal deities.
utils.itemsflavourtext.msg_armor_8=Only the impossible has any real charm; the possible has been vulgarized by happening too often.
utils.itemsflavourtext.msg_armor_9=Eons ago when your ancestors were defending their caves against the tiger and the mammoth, with crude spears of flint, the gold spires of my people split the stars!
utils.itemsflavourtext.msg_meleew_10=Believe nothing you hear, and only one half that you see.
utils.itemsflavourtext.msg_meleew_2=Everybody is a book of blood; wherever we're opened, we're red.
utils.itemsflavourtext.msg_meleew_3=The Devil pulls the strings which make us dance; \nWe find delight in the most loathsome things; \nSome furtherance of Hell each new day brings, \nAnd yet we feel no horror in that rank advance.
utils.itemsflavourtext.msg_meleew_4=Blood is really warm, \nit's like drinking hot chocolate \nbut with more screaming.
utils.itemsflavourtext.msg_meleew_5=Quiet people have the loudest minds.
utils.itemsflavourtext.msg_meleew_6=There are chords in the hearts of the most reckless which cannot be touched without emotion.
utils.itemsflavourtext.msg_meleew_7=Forget the future, \nForget the past. \nLife is over: \nBreathe your last.
utils.itemsflavourtext.msg_meleew_8=And I thought: History is like a horror story.
utils.itemsflavourtext.msg_meleew_9=We ask only to be reassured \nAbout the noises in the cellar \nAnd the window that should not have been open.
utils.itemsflavourtext.msg_missilew_10=All that we see or seem is but a dream within a dream. 
utils.itemsflavourtext.msg_missilew_2=Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary ...
utils.itemsflavourtext.msg_missilew_3=Sleep, those little slices of death — how I loathe them. 
utils.itemsflavourtext.msg_missilew_4=Never to suffer would never to have been blessed. 
utils.itemsflavourtext.msg_missilew_5=The best things in life make you sweaty.
utils.itemsflavourtext.msg_missilew_6=Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there, wondering, fearing, doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before.
utils.itemsflavourtext.msg_missilew_7=I remained too much inside my head and ended up losing my mind.
utils.itemsflavourtext.msg_missilew_8=I dread the events of the future, not in themselves but in their results.
utils.itemsflavourtext.msg_missilew_9=It is a happiness to wonder; -- it is a happiness to dream. 
utils.itemsflavourtext.msg_ring_10=Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky
utils.itemsflavourtext.msg_ring_2=Seven for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone
utils.itemsflavourtext.msg_ring_3=Nine for Mortal Men doomed to die
utils.itemsflavourtext.msg_ring_4=One for the Dark Lord on his dark throne \nIn the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.
utils.itemsflavourtext.msg_ring_5=One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, \nOne Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them
utils.itemsflavourtext.msg_ring_6=In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie
utils.itemsflavourtext.msg_ring_7=Ash nazg durbatulûk, ash nazg gimbatul, \nAsh nazg thrakatulûk agh burzum-ishi krimpatul!
utils.itemsflavourtext.msg_ring_8=And above all, watch with glittering eyes the whole world around you because the greatest secrets are always hidden in the most unlikely places. Those who don't believe in magic will never find it.
utils.itemsflavourtext.msg_ring_9=The moment you doubt whether you can fly, you cease for ever to be able to do it.
utils.itemsflavourtext.msg_stone_10=When the stars were right, They could plunge from world to world through the sky; but when the stars were wrong, They could not live.
utils.itemsflavourtext.msg_stone_2=They say foul beings of Old Times still lurk In dark forgotten corners of the world, And Gates still gape to loose, on certain nights, Shapes pent in Hell.
utils.itemsflavourtext.msg_stone_3=Mighty Messenger - Nyarlathothep from the world of Seven Suns To his earth place the Wood of N'gai, wither may come He Who Is Not to be Named'
utils.itemsflavourtext.msg_stone_4=All fled—all done, so lift me on the pyre— \nThe Feast is over, and the lamps expire.
utils.itemsflavourtext.msg_stone_5=On many occasions the curious atmospheric effects enchanted me vastly; these including a strikingly vivid mirage - the first I had ever seen - in which distant bergs became the battlements of unimaginable cosmic castles.
utils.itemsflavourtext.msg_stone_6=Even Azathoth is bored of this tune.
utils.itemsflavourtext.msg_stone_7=The world is thinner in some places.
utils.itemsflavourtext.msg_stone_8=They worshipped, so they said, the Great Old Ones who lived ages before there were any men, and who came to the young world out of the sky.
utils.itemsflavourtext.msg_stone_9=Those Old Ones were gone now, inside the earth and under the sea; but their dead bodies had told their secrets in dreams to the first men, who formed a cult which had never died.
utils.itemsflavourtext.msg_wand_10=Yog-Sothoth knows the gate. Yog-Sothoth is the gate. Yog-Sothoth is the key and guardian of the gate.
utils.itemsflavourtext.msg_wand_2=Past, present, future, all are one in Yog-Sothoth. He knows where the Old Ones broke through of old, and where They shall break through again.
utils.itemsflavourtext.msg_wand_3=And where Nyarlathotep went, rest vanished, for the small hours were rent with the screams of nightmare.
utils.itemsflavourtext.msg_wand_4=I am passing through unearthly angles; I am approaching - oh, the burning horror of it!
utils.itemsflavourtext.msg_wand_5=The other gods! The other gods! The gods of the outer hells that guard the feeble gods of earth!
utils.itemsflavourtext.msg_wand_6=These Great Old Ones, Castro continued, were not composed altogether of flesh and blood. They had shape — for did not this star-fashioned image prove it? — but that shape was not made of matter.
utils.itemsflavourtext.msg_wand_7=No words in our language can describe them!
utils.itemsflavourtext.msg_wand_8=The deeds of the dead move through angles in dim recesses of time. They are hungry and athirst!
utils.itemsflavourtext.msg_wand_9=In a single moment I fled screaming through time. I fled down quintillions of years.
utils.booktitles.foundbook=Du hast ein Buch gefunden:
